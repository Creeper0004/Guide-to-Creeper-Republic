## Loans

  Ammount | Interest | Minimum Networth (in millions) | Available?
  ------- | -------- | ------------------------------ | ----------
  $100k-$500k | 1% | 50 | Yes
  $500k-$10m | 2% | 100 | Yes 
  $10m-$100m | 5% | 500 | Yes
  $100m-500m | 10% | 2,000 | Citizens only
  500m-1b| 20% | 5,000 | Unvailable
  
  The total accumulated interest plus loan is given by this formular:
  ```
  P' = P(1+i)^t
  ```
  Where:
  - **P** is the original principal sum (the original loan)
  - **P'** is the new principal sum (loan plus interest)
  - **i** is the interest rate coverted to a decimal value (25%=0.25)
  - **t** is the overall length of time in weeks the interest is applied

  For example, a $100 loan for one month with a weekly interest rate of 5%:
  ```
  $121.55 â‰ˆ 100(1+0.05)^4
  ```
